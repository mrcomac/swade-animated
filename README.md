# Scripts
I didn't reinvent the wheel. I'm using [Sequencer](https://github.com/fantasycalendar/FoundryVTT-Sequencer) and [Token Magic](https://github.com/Feu-Secret/Tokenmagic). Also I'm using the macros created by [EskieMoh@](https://twitter.com/EskieMoh) and [SWADE Immersive Macros](https://github.com/SalieriC/SWADE-Immersive-Macros).
